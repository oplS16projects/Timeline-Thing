# Project Title: Timeline Thing
http://opls16projects.github.io/Timeline-Thing/

### Statement
A Timeline builder to help plan large scale projects

### Analysis
The idea is based on building a timeline from an existing database, so we will be working with databases like the ones from earlier in the semester.

### Data set or other source materials
Racket libraries:

'racket/include'

'racket/runtime-path'
  
'racket/date'

'web-server/templates'

'web-server/servlet'

'web-server/servlet-env'

'web-server/http'

'parser-tools/lex'

'xml'

'racket/list'

'db'

### Deliverable and Demonstration
A timeline builder that will allow users to create and edit timelines in real time.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know it will be successful if it works.
