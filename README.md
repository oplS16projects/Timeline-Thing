# Project Title: Timeline Thing
http://opls16projects.github.io/Timeline-Thing/

### Statement
A Timeline builder to help plan large scale projects

### Analysis
The idea is based on building a timeline from an existing database, so we will be working with databases like the ones from earlier in the semester.

### Data set or other source materials
Racket libraries:

`racket/include`

`racket/format`

`racket-include`

`racket/runtime-path`
  
`racket/date`

`web-server/formlets`

`web-server/templates`

`web-server/servlet`

`web-server/servlet-env`

`web-server/http`

`parser-tools/lex`

`xml`

`racket/list`

`db`

### Deliverable and Demonstration
A timeline builder that will allow users to create and edit timelines in real time.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know it will be successful if it works.
