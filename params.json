I like this expression because in writing it I learned a lot about databases and how to retrieve the id of posts within the database.\r\n```scheme\r\n(define (delete-entry! a-timeline n)\r\n  (query-exec\r\n   (timeline-db a-timeline)\r\n   \"DELETE FROM posts (title, body) WHERE id = n\"))\r\n```\r\n####Saurabh Verma @sv-uml\r\nI like this expression because it successfully converts the current version number from an external file, increments it by 0.01, then saves it back to the file. In a way, it's an almost perfect application version tracker that doesn't rely on a traditional database.\r\n```scheme\r\n(begin\r\n      (set! CURR_VERSION (+ (string->number (file->string FILE_VERSION_NAME)) 0.01))\r\n      (write-to-file FILE_VERSION_NAME CURR_VERSION))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#How to Download and Run\r\n####Latest Releases\r\nhttps://github.com/oplS16projects/Timeline-Thing/releases\r\n\r\nRun main.rkt to open the initial webpage.\r\n\r\n",
